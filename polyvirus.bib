	Abstract = { Viruses are the most abundant and the most diverse life form. In this meta-analysis we estimate that there are 4.80×1031 phages on Earth. Further, 97\% of viruses are in soil and sediment---two underinvestigated biomes that combined account for only ∼2.5\% of publicly available viral metagenomes. The majority of the most abundant viral sequences from all biomes are novel. Our analysis drawing on all publicly available viral metagenomes observed a mere 257,698 viral genotypes on Earth---an unrealistically low number---which attests to the current paucity of viral metagenomic data. Further advances in viral ecology and diversity call for a shift of attention to previously ignored major biomes and careful application of verified methods for viral metagenomic analysis. },

@article{Belshaw2007,
	Abstract = {The genomes of RNA viruses are characterized by their
	  extremely small size and extremely high mutation rates (typically 10 kb and
	      10−4/base/replication cycle, respectively), traits that are thought to be
	    causally linked. One aspect of their small size is the genome compression
	    caused by the use of overlapping genes (where some nucleotides code for two
		genes). Using a comparative analysis of all known RNA viral species, we show
	    that viruses with larger genomes tend to have less gene overlap. We provide a
	    numerical model to show how a high mutation rate could lead to gene overlap,
	  and we discuss the factors that might explain the observed relationship between
	    gene overlap and genome size. We also propose a model for the evolution of gene
	    overlap based on the co-opting of previously unused ORFs, which gives rise to
	    two types of overlap: (1) the creation of novel genes inside older genes,
	  predominantly via +1 frameshifts, and (2) the incremental increase in overlap
	    between originally contiguous genes, with no frameshift preference. Both types
	    of overlap are viewed as the creation of genomic novelty under pressure for
	    genome compression. Simulations based on our model generate the empirical size
	    distributions of overlaps and explain the observed frameshift preferences. We
	    suggest that RNA viruses are a good model system for the investigation of
	    general evolutionary relationship between genome attributes such as mutational
	    robustness, mutation rate, and size.},

@article{Boles1994,
	Abstract = {Open reading frames longer than 300 bases were observed in
	  the antisense strands of the genes coding for the glycolytic enzymes
	    phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase and alcohol
	    dehydrogenase I. The open reading frames on both strands are in codon register.
	    It has been suggested that proteins coded in codon register by complementary
	    DNA strands can bind to each other. Consequently, it was interesting to
	    investigate whether the open reading frames in the antisense strands of
	    glycolytic enzyme genes are functional. We used oligonucleotide-directed
	    mutagenesis of the PGI1 phosphoglucose isomerase gene to introduce pairs of
	    closely spaced base substitutions that resulted in stop codons in one strand
	    and only silent replacements in the other. Introduction of the two stop codons
	    into the PGI1 sense strand caused the same physiological defects as already
	    observed for pgil deletion mutants. No detectable effects were caused by the
	    two stop codons in the antisense strand. A deletion that removed a section from
	    -31 bp to +109 bp of the PGI1 gene but left 83 bases of the 3' region beyond
	    the antisense open reading frame had the same phenotype as a deletion removing
	    both reading frames. A similar pair of deletions of the PYK1 gene and its
	    antisense reading frame showed identical defects. Our own Northern experiments
	    and those reported by other authors using double-stranded probes detected only
	    one transcript for each gene. These observations indicate that the antisense
	    reading frames are not functional. On the other hand, evidence is provided to
	    show that the rather long reading frames in the antisense strands of these
	    glycolytic enzyme genes could arise from the strongly selective codon usage in
	    highly expressed yeast genes, which reduces the frequency of stop codons in the
	    antisense strand.},

@article{Chandler2015,
	Abstract = {Mosquitoes, most often recognized for the microbial agents
	  of disease they may carry, harbor diverse microbial communities that include
	    viruses, bacteria, and fungi, collectively called the microbiota. The
	    composition of the microbiota can directly and indirectly affect disease
	    transmission through microbial interactions that could be revealed by its
	    characterization in natural populations of mosquitoes. Furthermore, the use of
	    shotgun metagenomic sequencing (SMS) approaches could allow the discovery of
	    unknown members of the microbiota. In this study, we use RNA SMS to
	    characterize the microbiota of seven individual mosquitoes (species include
		Culex pipiens, Culiseta incidens, and Ochlerotatus sierrensis) collected from a
	    variety of habitats in California, USA. Sequencing was performed on the
	    Illumina HiSeq platform and the resulting sequences were quality-checked and
	    assembled into contigs using the A5 pipeline. Sequences related to single
	    stranded RNA viruses of the Bunyaviridae and Rhabdoviridae were uncovered,
	  along with an unclassified genus of double-stranded RNA viruses. Phylogenetic
	    analysis finds that in all three cases, the closest relatives of the identified
	    viral sequences are other mosquito-associated viruses, suggesting widespread
	    host-group specificity among disparate viral taxa. Interestingly, we identified
	    a Narnavirus of fungi, also reported elsewhere in mosquitoes, that potentially
	    demonstrates a nested host-parasite association between virus, fungi, and
	    mosquito. Sequences related to 8 bacterial families and 13 fungal families were
	    found across the seven samples. Bacillus and Escherichia/Shigella were
	    identified in all samples and Wolbachia was identified in all Cx. pipiens
	    samples, while no single fungal genus was found in more than two samples. This
	    study exemplifies the utility of RNA SMS in the characterization of the natural
	    microbiota of mosquitoes and, in particular, the value of identifying all
	    microbes associated with a specific host.},

Yet nothing is known about the viruses that infect these divergent eukaryotes. We investigated the \textit{Plasmodium} virome by performing a meta-transcriptomic analysis of blood samples from malaria patients infected with \textit{P. vivax, P. falciparum} or \textit{P. knowlesi}. This revealed a novel bi-segmented narna-like RNA virus restricted to \textit{P. vivax} and named Matryoshka RNA virus 1 (MaRNAV-1) to reflect its ``Russian doll'' nature: a virus, infecting a parasite, infecting an animal. MaRNAV-1 was abundant in geographically diverse \textit{P. vivax} from humans and mosquitoes. Notably, a related virus (MaRNAV-2) was identified in Australian birds infected with a \textit{Leucocytozoon} - eukaryotic parasites that group with \textit{Plasmodium} in the Apicomplexa subclass hematozoa. This is the first report of a \textit{Plasmodium} virus. As well as broadening our understanding of the eukaryotic virosphere, the restriction to \textit{P. vivax} may help understand \textit{P. vivax}-specific biology in humans and mosquitoes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Chirico2010,
	Abstract = {The genomes of most virus species have overlapping
	  genes---two or more proteins coded for by the same nucleotide sequence. Several
	    explanations have been proposed for the evolution of this phenomenon, and we
	    test these by comparing the amount of gene overlap in all known virus species.
	    We conclude that gene overlap is unlikely to have evolved as a way of
	    compressing the genome in response to the harmful effect of mutation because
	    RNA viruses, despite having generally higher mutation rates, have less gene
	    overlap on average than DNA viruses of comparable genome length. However, we do
	    find a negative relationship between overlap proportion and genome length among
	    viruses with icosahedral capsids, but not among those with other capsid types
	    that we consider easier to enlarge in size. Our interpretation is that a
	    physical constraint on genome length by the capsid has led to gene overlap
	    evolving as a mechanism for producing more proteins from the same genome
	    length. We consider that these patterns cannot be explained by other factors,
	  namely the possible roles of overlap in transcription regulation, generating
	    more divergent proteins and the relationship between gene length and genome

	  one or more segments of coding-sense RNA that function directly as messenger
	  RNAs upon release into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Positive-sense RNA
	  viruses are generally accepted to encode proteins solely on the positive
	  strand. However, we previously identified a surprisingly long
	  ({\textasciitilde}1000 codons) open reading frame (ORF) on the negative strand
	  of some members of the family which, together with RNA bacteriophages of the

	  C6/36 cells, Ae. aegypti Aag2 cells (cleared from cell fusing agent virus and

	  demonstrate that AP-61 and C6/36 cells do not produce siRNAs to WNV infection,

	Abstract = {Knowledge of viral diversity is expanding greatly, but many lineages remain underexplored. We surveyed RNA viruses in 52 cultured monoxenous relatives of the human parasite Leishmania (Crithidia and Leptomonas), as well as plant-infecting Phytomonas. Leptomonas pyrrhocoris was a hotbed for viral discovery, carrying a virus (Leptomonas pyrrhocoris ostravirus 1) with a highly divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase missed by conventional BLAST searches, an emergent clade of tombus-like viruses, and an example of viral endogenization. A deep-branching clade of trypanosomatid narnaviruses was found, notable as Leptomonas seymouri bearing Narna-like virus 1 (LepseyNLV1) have been reported in cultures recovered from patients with visceral leishmaniasis. A deep-branching trypanosomatid viral lineage showing strong affinities to bunyaviruses was termed ``Leishbunyavirus'' (LBV) and judged sufficiently distinct to warrant assignment within a proposed family termed ``Leishbunyaviridae.'' Numerous relatives of trypanosomatid viruses were found in insect metatranscriptomic surveys, which likely arise from trypanosomatid microbiota. Despite extensive sampling we found no relatives of the totivirus Leishmaniavirus (LRV1/2), implying that it was acquired at about the same time the Leishmania became able to parasitize vertebrates. As viruses were found in over a quarter of isolates tested, many more are likely to be found in the {\textgreater}600 unsurveyed trypanosomatid species. Viral loss was occasionally observed in culture, providing potentially isogenic virus-free lines enabling studies probing the biological role of trypanosomatid viruses. These data shed important insights on the emergence of viruses within an important trypanosomatid clade relevant to human disease.},

@article{Lebre2017,
	Abstract = {Overlapping genes exist in all domains of life and are much
	  more abundant than expected upon their first discovery in the late 1970s.
	    Assuming that the reference gene is read in frame +0, an overlapping gene can
	    be encoded in two reading frames in the sense strand, denoted by +1 and +2, and
	    in three reading frames in the opposite strand, denoted by −0, −1, and −2. This
	    motivated numerous researchers to study the constraints induced by the genetic
	    code on the various overlapping frames, mostly based on information theory. Our
	    focus in this paper is on the constraints induced on two overlapping genes in
	    terms of amino acids, as well as polypeptides. We show that simple linear
	    constraints bind the amino-acid composition of two proteins encoded by
	    overlapping genes. Novel constraints are revealed when polypeptides are
	    considered, and not just single amino acids. For example, in double-coding
	    sequences with an overlapping reading frame −2, each Tyrosine (denoted as Tyr
		or Y) in the overlapping frame overlaps a Tyrosine in the reference frame +0
	    (and reciprocally), whereas specific words (e.g. YY) never occur. We thus
	    distinguish between null constraints (YY = 0 in frame −2) and non-null
	    constraints (Y in frame +0 ⇔ Y in frame −2). Our equivalence-based constraints
	    are symmetrical and thus enable the characterization of the joint composition
	    of overlapping proteins. We describe several formal frameworks and a graph
	    algorithm to characterize and compute these constraints. As expected, the
	    degrees of freedom left by these constraints vary drastically among the
	    different overlapping frames. Interestingly, the biological meaning of
	    constraints induced on two overlapping proteins (hydropathy, forbidden
		di-peptides, expected overlap length {\ldots}) is also specific to the reading frame.
	    We study the combinatorics of these constraints for overlapping polypeptides of
	    length n, pointing out that, (i) except for frame −2, non-null constraints are
	    deduced from the amino-acid (length = 1) constraints and (ii) null constraints
	    are deduced from the di-peptide (length = 2) constraints. These results yield
	    support for understanding the mechanisms and evolution of overlapping genes,
	  and for developing novel overlapping gene detection methods.},

	Abstract = {The complete assembly of viral genomes from metagenomic
	  datasets (short genomic sequences gathered from environmental samples) has
	    proven to be challenging, so there are significant blind spots when we view
	    viral genomes through the lens of metagenomics. One approach to overcoming this
	    problem is to leverage the thousands of complete viral genomes that are
	    publicly available. Here we describe our efforts to assemble a comprehensive
	    resource that provides a quantitative snapshot of viral genomic trends -- such
	    as gene density, noncoding percentage, and abundances of functional gene
	    categories -- across thousands of viral genomes. We have also developed a
	    coarse-grained method for visualizing viral genome organization for hundreds of
	    genomes at once, and have explored the extent of the overlap between bacterial
	    and bacteriophage gene pools. Existing viral classification systems were
	    developed prior to the sequencing era, so we present our analysis in a way that
	    allows us to assess the utility of the different classification systems for
	    capturing genomic trends.},

@article{Merino1994,
	Abstract = {Long Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in antisense DNA strands
	  have been reported in the literature as being rare events. However, an
	    extensive analysis of the GenBank database revealed that a substantial number
	    of genes from several species contain an in-phase ORF in the antisense strand,
	  that overlaps entirely the coding sequence of the sense strand, or even extends
	    beyond. The findings described in this paper show that this is a frequent,
	  non-random phenomenon, which is primarily dependent on codon usage, and to a
	    lesser extent on gene size and GC content. Examination of the sequence database
	    for several prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, demonstrates that coding
	      sequences with in-phase, 100\% overlapping antisense ORFs are present in every
		genome studied so far.},

@article{Rancurel2009,
	Abstract = {It is widely assumed that new proteins are created by
	  duplication, fusion, or fission of existing coding sequences. Another mechanism
	    of protein birth is provided by overlapping genes. They are created de novo by
	    mutations within a coding sequence that lead to the expression of a novel
	    protein in another reading frame, a process called ``overprinting.'' To
	    investigate this mechanism, we have analyzed the sequences of the protein
	    products of manually curated overlapping genes from 43 genera of unspliced RNA
	    viruses infecting eukaryotes. Overlapping proteins have a sequence composition
	    globally biased toward disorder-promoting amino acids and are predicted to
	    contain significantly more structural disorder than nonoverlapping proteins. By
	    analyzing the phylogenetic distribution of overlapping proteins, we were able
	    to confirm that 17 of these had been created de novo and to study them
	    individually. Most proteins created de novo are orphans (i.e., restricted to
	    one species or genus). Almost all are accessory proteins that play a role in
	    viral pathogenicity or spread, rather than proteins central to viral
	    replication or structure. Most proteins created de novo are predicted to be
	    fully disordered and have a highly unusual sequence composition. This suggests
	    that some viral overlapping reading frames encoding hypothetical proteins with
	    highly biased composition, often discarded as noncoding, might in fact encode
	    proteins. Some proteins created de novo are predicted to be ordered, however,
	    and whenever a three-dimensional structure of such a protein has been solved,
	    it corresponds to a fold previously unobserved, suggesting that the study of
	    these proteins could enhance our knowledge of protein space.},
